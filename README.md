# Shiori.NET
A Fun and Wholesome Discord Bot, but in .NET!

`Shiori.NET` is a C# port of the original TypeScript version of [shiori](https://github.com/ShioriLabs/shiori). I made this only for learning .NET (even this README is copy-pasted from there)

## Setting Up
If you want to try `Shiori.NET`, you need to run it by yourself since it's still not production-ready.
